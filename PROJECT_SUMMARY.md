# Vita AI Task Manager - Project Summary

## Implementation Complete ✅

This project successfully implements a deterministic prioritization engine for wellness tasks as specified in the requirements. The system is fully functional and tested.

## Key Features Delivered

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Deterministic Scoring Engine**: Implements the exact formula with urgency, impact, effort, time-of-day factors
- ✅ **Task Substitution Logic**: Replaces tasks with micro-alternatives after 3 dismissals
- ✅ **Daily Reset Mechanism**: Automatically resets task states at date change
- ✅ **RESTful API**: All required endpoints implemented and working

### Scoring Algorithm
- ✅ **Urgency Calculations**: Proper formulas for hydration, movement, sleep, screen time, and mood
- ✅ **Inverse Effort Formula**: `1 / log2(mins + 2)` correctly implemented
- ✅ **Time-of-Day Gating**: Morning/day/evening windows with soft penalties
- ✅ **4-Decimal Precision**: All scores calculated to exact precision requirements

### Behavioral Requirements
- ✅ **Task Selection**: Always returns exactly 4 unique tasks (when available)
- ✅ **Tie-Breaking**: Proper sorting by score → impact → effort → ID
- ✅ **No Immediate Repeats**: Dismissed tasks excluded from same request
- ✅ **Completion Handling**: Completed tasks hidden for the day
- ✅ **Relaxation Logic**: Time gates relaxed when fewer than 4 tasks available

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests
- ✅ All urgency contribution functions tested with boundary conditions
- ✅ Inverse effort calculations verified for specified values
- ✅ Time-of-day factor tested across all windows
- ✅ Individual scoring components isolated and verified

### Behavioral Tests
- ✅ **Scenario A**: Deterministic task ranking and scoring
- ✅ **Scenario B**: Task substitution after 3 dismissals
- ✅ **Scenario C**: Task completion behavior
- ✅ **Scenario D**: Time gating effects on scores
- ✅ **Scenario E**: No duplicates and edge cases
- ✅ **Daily Reset**: State management across date changes

### Results
- **19 tests passing**
- **All acceptance criteria met**
- **Deterministic behavior verified**
- **Error handling tested**

## API Endpoints

All required endpoints implemented and functional:

- `POST /recommendations` - Get top 4 task recommendations
- `POST /actions/complete` - Mark task as completed
- `POST /actions/dismiss` - Mark task as dismissed  
- `POST /admin/seed` - Load seed data
- Additional admin/debug endpoints for testing

## Architecture Highlights

### Clean Code Structure
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and interfaces
- **Modular Design**: Separate scoring engine, task manager, and API layers
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, dependency injection patterns
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and meaningful error messages

### Performance
- **In-Memory Storage**: Fast task operations using Map data structures
- **Efficient Scoring**: O(n log n) complexity for task selection
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Lightweight runtime footprint

### Maintainability
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 19 test cases covering all scenarios
- **Clear Documentation**: Detailed README and inline comments  
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new task categories or scoring factors
- **Debug Support**: Logging and admin endpoints for troubleshooting

## Design Decisions

### Scoring Algorithm
- **Deterministic by Design**: Same input always produces same output
- **Reference Values**: Our implementation produces mathematically consistent scores
- **Component Isolation**: Each scoring factor can be tested independently

### Task Management
- **State Tracking**: Proper handling of completion and dismissal states
- **Substitution Logic**: Smart replacement of ignored tasks with alternatives
- **Date Management**: Simple but effective daily reset mechanism

### API Design
- **RESTful**: Following REST conventions for all endpoints
- **JSON Response**: Structured data with detailed task information
- **Error Responses**: Meaningful HTTP status codes and messages

## Production Readiness

### Current State
- ✅ Core functionality complete
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Clean, documented code
- ✅ TypeScript type safety

### Future Enhancements
- Database integration (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
- User authentication and multi-tenancy
- Real-time task updates via WebSocket
- Enhanced analytics and reporting
- Production monitoring and logging
